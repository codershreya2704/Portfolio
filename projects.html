        <h1>Student Smart Card</h1>
        <p>Developed a student smart card system for the college students to 
            ease their daily university transaction. 
            We have developed a website through which university admin can check and perform transaction and 
            student registeration. To perform Transaction we have added a scanner system which we often see in the 
            super market and scan students card on which there will be a barcode and after scanning the transaction 
            will be automatically done with whatever payement mentioned.

        <h1>Traning and Placement Cell</h1>
        <p>Developed a Traning and Placement Cell for college to track students data, companies data,
            interview schedule etc. This platform is very useful for both students and companies as it provides 
            function to upload students resume, students can track their application status and TPO can track students 
            placement status and count. We have also added a practice section for students and prepare for the interviews.

        <h1>Social Media Using BlockChain</h1>
        <h4>Ongoing project</h4>
        <p>This is my final year project in which we are developing a social media 
            similar to instagram with added feature called TOKENS.
            Lots of influencers and users watching their videos can benefit from it by users giving 
            their favorite influencers a money in form of tokens and we have added feature where after influencers hit certain 
            follower list the users get some percentage of amount in return for investing in their favorite influencers.
            We are going to add SMART CONTRACTS where we will be designing our own crypto alogirthm from which transaction can be done.
